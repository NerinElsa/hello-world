Learn the basics of GitHub
I have been using GitHub for a while now. But it is time to review the basics!

# About Me
I am Nerin Elsa George. I am a software engineer who is interested in creating web front-ends. 

I have started out by developing a web front-end using a content management system(CMS) called Kompozer for United Nations Industrial Development Organization, an international organization within the UN secretariat in Vienna, Austria. Thereafter, I have also worked in IT project management field and took PRINCE2 Foundation certification. After having several years of baby break, I have refreshed my skills and knowledge by completing the Google Udacity Developer Challenge 2017. This also gave me an opportunity to undertake the Mobile Web Developer Nano Degree program offereded by Udacity. Through this program I have updated my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills. Moreover, after successful completion, I have taught myself various libraries, and frameworks for frontend development such as, Angular, React and C#.

Recently, I have joined Cademix Institute of Technology located in Vienna as Web Software Developer Associate to investigate and to develop AI infused mobile web apps :)

Front-end technologies are changing always and new libraries and frameworks with better capabilities are being released frequently. There is never a dull moment with front-end development plus a lot to learn always! I believe in life long learning and the need for constant upgrading of coding skills to stay in the field!
